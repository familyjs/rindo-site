# Framework Integration

Rindo's primary goal is to remove the need for components to be written using a specific framework's API. It accomplishes this by using standardized web platform APIs that work across all modern browsers. Using the low-level component model that is provided by the browser (which all frameworks are built on) allows Rindo components to work inside of a framework or without one.

Rindo's integration with different frameworks is currently a work in progress. As Rindo matures, the goal is to make it easy to write standard web components which will compile to various output targets. This allows developers to stay aligned with the latest web standards while using a common API. The generated components will also be more future-proof as frameworks continue to change.

The following list contains the framework integrations that have been started. All of them are not yet completed.
