# Typed Components

Web Components generated with Rindo come with type declaration files automatically generated by the Rindo compiler.

In general, Typescript declarations provide strong guarantees when consuming components:

- Ensuring that proper values are passed down as properties
- Code autocompletion in modern IDEs such as VSCode
- Events' details
- Signature of components' methods

These public types are automatically generated by Rindo in `src/component.d.ts`.
This file allows for strong typing in JSX (just like React) and `HTMLElement` interfaces for each component.

:::warning
It is recommended that this file be checked in with the rest of your code in source control .
:::
Because Web Components generated by Rindo are just vanilla Web Components, they extend the `HTMLElement` interface.
For each component a type named `HTML{CamelCaseTag}Element` is registered at the global scope.
This means developers DO NOT have to import them explicitly, just like `HTMLElement` or `HTMLScriptElement` are not imported.

- `nav-button` => `HTMLNavButtonElement`
- `nav-menu-controller` => `HTMLNavMenuControllerElement`

```tsx
const button: HTMLNavButtonElement = document.queryElement('nav-button');
button.fill = 'outline';
```

**IMPORTANT**: always use the `HTML{}Element` interfaces in order to hold references to components.
