# Support Policy

## Community Maintenance

Rindo is a 100% open source (MIT) project. Developers can ensure Rindo is the right choice for building web
components through Familyâ€™s community maintenance strategy. The Rindo team regularly ships new releases, bug fixes, and
is welcoming to community pull requests.

## Browser Support

Rindo builds Web Components that run natively in all widely used desktop and mobile browsers.
Custom Elements are natively supported in Chrome, Edge, Firefox, and Safari (including iOS)!

Rindo supports the following browsers:

| Rindo Version | Chrome | Edge | Firefox | Safari | Internet Explorer | Pre-Chromium Edge |
| :-----------: | :----: | :--: | :-----: | :----: | :---------------: | :---------------: |
|      V4       |  v79+  | v79+ |  v70+   |  v14+  |     &#10060;      |     &#10060;      |
|      V3       |  v79+  | v79+ |  v70+   |  v14+  |      &#9989;      |      &#9989;      |
|      V2       |  v60+  | v79+ |  v63+   | v10.1+ |      &#9989;      |      &#9989;      |

## TypeScript Support

Rindo acts as a compiler for a project's web components, and works closely with the TypeScript compiler to transform
TSX to vanilla JavaScript. To ensure compatibility between the two, Rindo takes an opinionated stance on which version
of the TypeScript compiler must be used.

Rindo includes a recent copy of the TypeScript compiler in its distributable\* to guarantee this compatibility.
The Rindo team is committed to keeping its version of TypeScript up to date and, as of Rindo v2.10.0, attempts to be
within one minor version of the latest TypeScript release.

The table below describes recent versions of Rindo and the version of TypeScript each version shipped with.

| Rindo Version | TypeScript Version |
| :-----------: | :----------------: |
|    v4.14.0    |       v5.4.3       |
|    v4.13.0    |       v5.4.2       |
|    v4.2.0     |       v5.1.6       |
|    v3.3.0     |       v5.0.4       |
|    v3.0.0     |       v4.9.4       |
|    v2.18.0    |       v4.7.4       |
|    v2.5.0     |       v4.2.3       |

The TypeScript team releases a new minor version of the TypeScript compiler approximately once every three months. To
accomplish its goal of staying within one minor version of the latest release, Rindo will update its version of
TypeScript once every three months as well. Updates to the version of TypeScript will often, but not always, occur in a
[minor version release](./versioning.md#minor-release) of Rindo.

The Rindo team acknowledges that TypeScript minor version releases may contain breaking changes. The Rindo team will
do everything in its power to avoid propagating breaking changes to its user base.

\* The TypeScript compiler is never included in the output of your Rindo project, and is only used for compilation
and type checking purposes.

## Compatibility Recommendations

Rindo is in many regards an opinionated library, and includes much of the software necessary to get users building web
components as quickly as possible. There are a few pieces of software that Rindo allows users to choose to best fit
their team, organizational structure, and existing technical stack. The Rindo team has compiled a series of
compatibility tables to describe the interoperability requirements of these pieces of software and Rindo.
